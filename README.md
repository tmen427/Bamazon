# Bamazon


For this assignment we wanted to create an simplifed version of an Amazon like app which used a sql database that contained a table with ten different items in it. To interact with those items we used Inquirer module in Node.Js to display information about the sql database and used the command line to "purchase" items that we wanted.

Choose the i.d. of an item that you want and enter the quantity. If the quantity is less then or equal to the amount that is available then the program calculates the price of items bought.

If you want to buy more items than are available the program says, 'Insufficent quantity! Buy Something else'!
